#### I'm an 18 year old programmer mainly interested in low level development and hacking

##### Most of the coding I have done has been in C and assembly, but I also have some webdev experience with javascript, from completing the javascript course in the The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript

##### I also have some hacking experience from competing in CTFs, where I have used Python, PHP and JavaScript


#### Languages I have used:
  - C
  - x86 assembly
  - Bash
  - JavaScript
  - Python (some scripting) 
  - PHP (a little bit in CTFs)


### Some of my projects:

#### Shell:
  This is a simple implementation of a basic unix shell, part of the CS537 course that I completed       
  https://github.com/wunderboyy/shell
  
#### Assembler:
  This is an assembler for the Hack Assembly language that is used in the Nand2Tetris course    
  Hack Assembly is very small, barely has variables.

#### Franklin OS:
  A small and unfinished unix like kernel (pretty shitty but can go to userspace)   
  https://github.com/wunderboyy/franklin
  
#### Network stack
  A network stack for MentOS operating system  (very small, literally only udp and loop back interface) 
  I made this just because i wanted to understand how the kernel deals with networking (this is inspired by the 4.4 bsd network stack)
